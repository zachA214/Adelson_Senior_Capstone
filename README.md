# ✍️ Version Naming Convention
Versions of release will be named in the following format

<strong>(build version)-v(version number).(subversion number)-(epoch date of release of the version)</strong>

### Build Version
The build version refers to how close to live the release version is, usually following this order <br>
-> Alpha | For very early proof of concept builds <br>
-> Beta | For more working but missing full functionality builds <br>
-> Live | For full functoinality builds, not necessarily all features are finished however <br>
-> Full | Final production build <br>

### Version Number
For iterations of a build version that incorporate big changes. For instance when a new feature is added or majorly reformatted. <br>
<strong>Examples:</strong> <br>
-> Alpha v2.0 <br>
-> Beta v7.2 <br>
-> Alpha 1.2 <br>
-> Live 2.1 <br>
> **_NOTE:_**  The full release build will not include a version number

### SubVersion Number
The subversion number is appended after a period that is placed immediately following the version number. <br>
<strong>Examples:</strong> <br>
-> Alpha v2.4 <br>
-> Alpha v2.1 <br>
-> Beta v1.1 <br>
-> Beta v1.7 <br>
-> Live v4.0 <br>
-> Live v4.1 <br>
> **_NOTE:_**  The full release build will not include a subversion number
