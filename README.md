# Penetration Testing Toolkit - Name Pending
This tool is being built and designed as my WSU 2025 senior capstone project for Cybersecurity

The tool will offer the following capabilities:
- A visually appealing GUI
- Simple penetration testing tools (Network Mapping, Password Cracking, etc.)
- Basic automation
- Built-in terminal for any command-line needs
- Encrypted internal notebook for any private note taking related to penetration tests

# Version Naming Convention
Versions of release will be named in the following format

<strong>(build version)-v(version number).(subversion number)-(epoch date of release of the version)</strong>

### Build Version
The build version refers to how close to live the release version is, usually following this order
- Alpha | For very early proof of concept builds
- Beta | For more working but missing full functionality builds
- Live | For full functoinality builds, not necessarily all features are finished however
- Full | Final production build

### Version Number
For iterations of a build version that incorporate big changes. For instance when a new feature is added or majorly reformatted. <br>
Examples:
- Alpha v2.0
- Beta v7.2
- Alpha 1.2
- Live 2.1
> **_NOTE:_**  The full release build will not include a version number

### SubVersion Number
The subversion number is appended after a period that is placed immediately following the version number. <br>
Examples:
- Alpha v2.4
- Alpha v2.1
- Beta v1.1
- Beta v1.7
- Live v4.0
- Live v4.1
> **_NOTE:_**  The full release build will not include a subversion number
